        <h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
          <span>
            <p class="blogentry"> I'm not talking about the Will Smith movie. Life is tough. The least you can do is find something that makes you happy and pursue it. No matter what people tell you, remember you control your life. You control your journey. Your journey is unique to you.

                As long as I can remember I have had some type of depression.  Growing up I always felt like the black sheep in my family.  I felt as if my family, the ones who are supposed to love me unconditionally, did not love me.  I felt as if no matter what I did they would never love me, nor would they like anything I do.  I always felt like I was the outlier, the one who would grow up to disappoint the family.  Along my journey growing up, this disconnect led to me burying my emotions and becoming dethatched.  I hid my emotions and became as cold hearted as I could.  This isn’t the answer.  It just leads to more problems.

                I will not go into my life.  The point is that in order to continue your journey to find your happiness you may need some help along the way.  Build a support system comprised of the ones you trust the most.  Mines is comprised of my wife, my cousin, my best friends, and my grandmother primarily.  They help me stay focused and keep me motivated to push forward.

                Another thing to keep I mind when it comes to your journey is to look at it like a race.  Each racer needs a trainer.  In this case the trainer would be a therapist.  I recently realized it was time to go to a therapist.  The simple reason I did this is because I deserve to be happy.  You deserve to be happy.  We all deserve to be happy, but in order to be happy we must work with a trainer to condition our brains to be happy.  Life is a race, and happiness is the finish line.  Having someone who can dissect what you are doing, and help you improve and reach your goal.  It may seem like getting a therapist is admitting that you are ‘crazy’, but that isn’t the case.  I used to think the same Seeking a therapist means that you are looking to improve yourself, so you can find your happiness.

                As I said before, we all deserve to be happy.  The first step is to re-work your approach to happiness.  I have started this journey, and I am excited to be happy for the first time in a long time.  Hopefully my words will inspire you all to do the same.
